# Barefoot

Barefoot is an open source Java library for online and offline map matching with OpenStreetMap, developed by the BMW car's IT department.\
This fork is part of an experiment that uses Barefoot to match bus routes defined in GTFS files to OpenStreetMap's road map.

This README file describes the additions and changes made to the original library and how to use it to map-match GTFS bus routes. You can find more information on Barefoot in the [original README file](barefoot_README.md).
